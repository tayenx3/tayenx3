```rust
trait Helpful {
    fn can_help_with(&self) -> Vec<&' static str>;
}

impl<T> Helpful for T
where
  T: CompilerNerd
{
    fn can_help_with(&self) -> Vec<&'static str> {
        vec![
            "dumb questions about parsing",
            "borrow checker confusion",
            "wanting to contribute but not knowing where to start",
        ]
    }
}

fn hi() {
    let me: Know<If> = You { need: Something };
}
```
